	Duration 		:  Jan’2012 to Dec’2012    	  
Description:
	           Workflow Suite (WFS) is a suite of applications designed around business process management capabilities to support business process management. The core user-facing application in the suite where users do their work is the Worklist application. It is a web-based application where business users interact with manual activities which need to be executed as part of a business process.
In the context of WFS, a workflow is a sequence of tasks carried out as a part of a process. A workflow may consist of a single task or multiple tasks and the multiple tasks need not be in a linear arrangement. 
WFS, there are two types of workflows – predefined workflow and manual/ helpdesk workflow Predefined workflows are automatically run by the system while manual workflows involve much more user activities. Predefined workflows and manual (helpdesk) workflows differ in a lot of aspects, for example, business objective, related processes, capabilities and information on task details page. In the following part of this guide, the Predefined Flows section is dedicated to explain predefined workflow and tasks; the Manual Workflow section is dedicated to explain manual (helpdesk) workflow and tasks.
Roles and Responsibilities:

●	Checking the CR List in ALM(Application Lifecycle Management) and completing the target CRs on date.
●	Implement the code according to the CR and deploy to Weblogic Server in Development Layer(DEV Layer)
●	Testing the code implementation in Testing server Layer(SYSTEST Layer)
●	Update in ALM that the CR is ready for testing and Check in the code into the HP repository (Borland StarTeam)
●	After the build is finished in ITG Layer then recheck the code changes for the CR

	Title			:  User Access Management(UAM)
	Client			:  Hewlett Packard (M) Sdn.Bhd,Malaysia.
	Environment		:  EJB 2.0,Servlets,Weblogic 10.3.3,BPEL,WebServices,SOA
	Duration 		:  Jan’2012 to Aug’2012

The UAM application will be used to monitor and control user access to WFS.
Business Case:
To fulfill audit requirements, WFS must be able to demonstrate the following:
●	Who has access to WFS?
●	Has the user been approved to access WFS?
●	Who has approved user access?
●	When was the user approved for access?
●	Justification for user access
●	Only approved users are given access to WFS
●	Users are reviewed periodically to determine whether WFS access should be retained
The WFS application does not incorporate a formal approval process, nor does it maintain justification for continued user access. Therefore, users will be required to employ UAM to receive and sustain access to WFS. Using a UAM interface, WFS will utilize UAM services that accept user requests to access the application, provides user approval processes, and maintains request history.
Roles and Responsibilities:

●	Created the Services involved for the project Implementation
●	Implement the code according to the CR and deploy to Weblogic Server in Development Layer(DEV Layer)
